/* To eliminate false sharing we want to make sure that each element of the
 * instances array is in a separate cache line.  This involves two steps: first,
 * we have to round up the size of each element so that it's a multiple of the
 * cache line size.  This is handled in the fleet.h public header file with all
 * of the calls to flt_round_to_cache_line.  Second, we have to make sure that
 * the start of the array is also rounded to a cache line.  malloc() doesn't
 * guarantee this, and if we get an unaligned array, then each element will span
 * a cache line boundary, and we'll definitely get some false sharing.
 *
 * To support this second step, we have two pointers for the array of elements.
 * unaligned_instances is the raw pointer that we get back from malloc().
 * public.instances is guaranteed to be aligned to a cache line.  This aligned
 * pointer is visible via the public API, and is how user code gets pointers to
 * the individual elements of the array.  We have to keep the unaligned pointer
 * around, as well, since we'll have to pass the same pointer to free() that we
 * got from malloc().
