# Update the VERSION and SOVERSION properties below according to the following
# rules (taken from [1]):
#
# VERSION = current.revision.age
#
#   1. Start with a VERSION of `0.0.0` for each shared library.
#   2. Update VERSION only immediately before a public release of your software.
#      More frequent updates are unnecessary, and only guarantee that the
#      current interface number gets larger faster.
#   3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, then
#      increment `revision` (`c.r.a` becomes `c.r+1.a`).
#   4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
#      update, increment `current`, and set `revision` to 0.
#   5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
#      increment `age`.
#   6. If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last public
#      release, then set `age` to 0.
#
# SOVERSION should always equal `current`.
#
# Note that changing `current` means that you are releasing a new
# backwards-incompatible version of the library.  This has implications on
# packaging, so once an API has stabilized, these should be a rare occurrence.
