# NAME

flt_detach, flt_reattach -- Handling blocking syscalls

# SYNOPSIS

| **#include &lt;fleet.h&gt;**
|
| void
| **flt_detach**(struct flt \**flt*);
|
| void
| **flt_reattach**(struct flt \**flt*);


# DESCRIPTION

If you have a task that needs to make a blocking syscall --- to read from a file
or network socket, for instance --- then you ideally want other fleet tasks to
be able to proceed while the original task is blocked.  If you don't, then you
can easily stall the entire fleet (for instance, if all of the threads that the
fleet creates are blocked).

To handle this situation, well-behaved tasks should *detach* their execution
context immediately before making a blocking call, and should *reattach* once it
returns.  This allows the fleet's scheduler to shift any scheduled tasks to
other execution contexts, allowing them to proceed during the blocking call.

For example:

    static flt_task  read_file;

    struct state {
        FILE  *file;
        char  *buf;
        size_t  buf_size;
    };

    static void
    parent_task(struct flt *flt, void *ud, size_t i)
    {
        struct state  *state = ud;
        size_t  bytes_read;

        flt_detach(flt);
        bytes_read = fread(state->buf, state->buf_size, 1, state->file);
        flt_reattach(flt);

        /* Do something with the data that was just read */
    }
